# Design-first APIs workshop

This workshop's goal is to introduce how to design APIs using OAS/Swagger and what you could get from its ecosystem/tooling with no/little implementation. It consists of different exercises:

- Exercise 1: Writing your first OAS Document.
- Exercise 2: Using the autogenerated Client SDK
- Exercise 3: Using a Server Stub
- Exercise 4: TBD

You can find the final version of API Spec we are going to use [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/nodeconf18-api-spec/nodeconf-api/1.0.0).
